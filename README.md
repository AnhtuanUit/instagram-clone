# Instagram Clone Project

Welcome to the Instagram Clone project! This project aims to replicate the core features and functionalities of the Instagram social media platform using ReactJS, ReactQuery, and various modern frontend technologies. In this README, we'll outline the ideation, planning, and execution process of building this project.

## Ideation and Planning

### Features Breakdown

To start, we'll use draw.io or any diagramming tool to plan out the features and pages of our Instagram clone. Here's a breakdown of some key features:

1. **Homepage Feed**: Displays posts from followed users and suggested posts.
2. **Profile**: Users can view their own profile with posts, followers, following, and edit their profile details.
3. **Explore**: Discover new users, hashtags, and trending posts.
4. **Post Creation**: Upload images or videos, add captions, and tag users.
5. **Like and Comment**: Interact with posts by liking and commenting.
6. **Direct Messaging**: Send and receive private messages with other users.
7. **Notifications**: Receive notifications for likes, comments, and new followers.
8. **Search**: Search for users, hashtags, and posts.

### Component Structure

We'll structure the project into reusable components to maintain a clean and scalable codebase. Components such as Navbar, PostCard, Profile, Explore, and DirectMessages will be created and reused throughout the application.

### Design Planning

Before diving into development, we'll plan out the design aspects including:

- Text styles and fonts
- Color palette
- Component designs and layouts

## Technologies Used

- ReactJS: Frontend library for building user interfaces.
- ReactQuery: For data fetching and caching.
- Vite: Build tooling for modern web development.
- Redux: For managing global state (optional).
- Redux Thunk: Middleware for asynchronous actions (optional).
- Redux Toolkit: Utility functions to simplify Redux logic (optional).
- Context API: For managing local component state.
- Hooks: For functional components to manage state and lifecycle.
- Custom Hooks: To encapsulate reusable logic.
- Memoization: Optimization techniques using `memo`, `useMemo`, and `useCallback`.
- TypeScript: Although not used in this project, it's worth mentioning for future considerations.
